### 📖 Introduction

**Slay the Model** is a Python-based core game framework for *Slay the Spire*.

Unlike the decompiled original code, this project is redesigned from a software engineering perspective, achieving **complete separation of presentation and logic layers**, providing a clean, extensible, and research-friendly game system kernel.

#### 🎯 Motivation

Slay the Spire has excellent gameplay design, but from a software engineering perspective, the original code has some issues:

- Heavy coupling between presentation and logic layers
- High complexity in base classes
- Difficult to conduct large-scale parallel experiments

Therefore, this project rewrites a clean, logically independent core framework without involving the graphics system.

#### ✨ Key Features

- 🏗️ **Clean Architecture**: Complete separation of presentation and logic layers, modular code structure
- 🎮 **Complete Game Mechanics**: Card combat, relic system, potion system, event system, etc.
- 🤖 **AI Interface Support**: Support for LLM-based automatic game decision-making
- 🔬 **Debug Mode**: Support for random testing, god mode, and other debugging features
- ⚡ **Parallel Execution**: No graphics dependency, can run multiple game instances in parallel
- 🌍 **Localization**: Support for Chinese and English
- ⚙️ **Highly Configurable**: Customize game parameters via YAML config files

#### 🎓 Use Cases

- **Game Developers**: Reference for core architecture design of card games
- **Researchers**: Conduct game AI and reinforcement learning research
- **Content Creators**: Quickly test and verify game mechanics

### 🏗️ Architecture Design

#### Core Design Principles

1. **Combat State Machine**: Combat start → (Player turn → Enemy turn) loop
2. **Action Execution Queue**: Classic framework for non-realtime games, one action triggers another
3. **Localization System**: Only use keys in game code, localization system looks up corresponding strings
4. **Simplified Base Class Design**: Card base class is only ~500 lines (vs thousands in decompiled code)

### ⚙️ Configuration

The configuration file is located at `config/game_config.yaml`. For first-time use, copy the template:

```bash
cp config/game_config_template.yaml config/game_config.yaml
```

#### Game Modes

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `human` | Human control via TUI interface |
| `ai` | AI control with LLM automatic decision-making |
| `debug` | Debug mode with random input testing |

#### Configuration Options

| Option | Description | Values |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| `mode` | Game mode | `human` / `ai` / `debug` |
| `language` | Interface language | `zh` (Chinese) / `en` (English) |
| `seed` | Random seed | Any integer |
| `character` | Character | `Ironclad` (currently only Ironclad supported) |
| `ascension` | Ascension level | `0-20` (0 means no ascension) |

#### AI Mode Configuration

```yaml
ai:
  api_key: YOUR_API_KEY        # API key
  api_base: YOUR_MODEL_API_BASE # API endpoint
  model: YOUR_MODEL             # Model name
  stream: True                  # Stream output
  temperature: 0.7              # Temperature
  max_tokens: 8192             # Max tokens
  timeout: 60                   # Timeout (seconds)
```

#### Debug Mode Configuration

```yaml
debug:
  print: False          # Print debug info
  select_type: random   # Selection type: random / first
  god_mode: False       # God mode (enemies have 1 HP)
```

### 🚀 Running the Project

#### TUI Mode (Default)

```bash
python __main__.py
```

#### CLI Mode (No UI)

```bash
python __main__.py --no-tui
```

---

### 🔬 Research Applications

#### Parallel Experiments

Without graphics dependencies, the framework supports running multiple game instances in parallel, suitable for:

- Large-scale AI battle evaluation
- Reinforcement learning training data collection
- Game balance testing

#### Reinforcement Learning Integration

The framework provides clear state/action interfaces, easy to integrate with RL algorithms:

- State space: Player HP, deck, relics, enemy info, etc.
- Action space: Play cards, use potions, end turn, etc.
- Reward signals: Combat victory, damage output, survival rounds, etc.

### 🛠️ Development Tools

This project is developed using Vibe Coding, with main tools:

- **IDE**: VS Code + Opencode
- **Models**: GLM-5 (architecture design) + Codex-5.3 (code implementation)

#### Development Experience

> 💡 **Core Principle**: Humans handle structural constraints, models handle implementation

1. **Architecture First**: Define state machines, Action queues, localization systems, base class designs first
2. **External Knowledge Fetching**: Pull card effects, monster stats, and other data via MCP/Web Skills
3. **Iterative Testing**: Use automated testing for iterative verification
